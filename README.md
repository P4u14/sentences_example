# Repo Sentences Paula Altavo

## Steps to run the project:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

```bash
docker-compose -f .\dockercompose.yml up 
```
It is possible that Spring will fail on the first boot. This is because the database is not ready yet. Just restart the Spring container and it should work on the second boot without any problems.

For creating the first collection:
```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/collections/add' \
--form 'name="Kurze MÃ¤rchen"'
```

For viewing all existing collections:
```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/collections/'
```

For creating the first sentence:
```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/sentences/add' \
--form 'text="Es war einmal"' \
--form 'pronunciation="prononciation text"' \
--form 'collectionId="1"'
```

For viewing all existing sentences:
```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/sentences/'
```

You can search by id, name, ... as well as update and delete the collections and sentences.
